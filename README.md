So... Like....


Install instructions (vaugely): WINDOWS ONLY, it can work on other OS, but you can figure that out on your own.

Unzip the debug.zip folder  
copy all files from that unzipped folder into the directory containing your game.exe files, replace conflicting files with the files from debug.zip    
copy all files from the www/ folder in this repo to the www/ folder of your game  
open the modData folder and find the globalModData.json file,  ensure the below line is in the file somewhere:

open the game, host a game and start it by yourself  
create a new game  
save the new game  
now you can host a server and have friends connect. YOU CAN ONLY LOAD existing saves, it will likley be a black screen if you try to create a new save in the multiplayer menu while in a real lobby.
